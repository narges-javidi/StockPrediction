## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python (for data analysis and ML modeling)
- Pandas, NumPy (for data preprocessing)
- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning models)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (for visualizations)
- Streamlit (for an interactive web app)
- Yahoo Finance API / Alpha Vantage API (for fetching real-time stock data)
- Flask / FastAPI (optional backend for API handling)

## 📂 Dataset

The app retrieves historical stock data using APIs.

Preprocessed data includes date, open price, close price, high, low, volume, and technical indicators.
